  "description": "Minimal, self-contained Python code to explore the coherence-gradient chaos framework introduced in: Valamontes, A., \"Chaos as a Coherence–Gradient Phenomenon: A DLSFH–SGCV–MC Analysis\" (manuscript). The package implements a three-node VID chain, linearized ∞-tensor propagator, operator-norm and spectral-radius criteria, and numerical estimation of the coherence-gradient Lyapunov exponent λ_CG. It is explicitly model-dependent and designed as a reproducibility companion to the manuscript.",
